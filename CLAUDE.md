- Avoid adding comments that imply some delta or evolution of the code (i.e "Added X to reflect new requirements" or "Improve handling of X")
- Don't ever give estimates in ANY timeframes, i.e. 2 weeks/hrs/days
- No 'for now' implementations - if you're unable to complete the full implementation, say so and document a handoff
