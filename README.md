# Lasso RPC

**A smart blockchain RPC aggregator for building bulletproof onchain applications.**

Building reliable blockchain applications is challenging, largely due to the complexity of choosing and managing RPC providers. With dozens of providers offering different performance, pricing models, and reliability guarantees, developers face an opaque decision that directly impacts their application's user experience.

Lasso solves this by acting as an intelligent proxy that sits between your application and multiple RPC providers. While it provides the same JSON-RPC endpoints for WebSocket and HTTP that you'd expect from any provider, Lasso orchestrates **all** your providers across **all** your chains. It automatically routes requests to the best-performing provider, handles failures gracefully, and gives you the reliability and performance to build consumer-grade onchain applications.

Want to bypass rate limits? Configure Lasso to target multiple free providers and load balance between them:

```
POST /rpc/base # Automatically load balances across available providers
```

Want the fastest possible responses? Lasso routes to your best-performing provider using real-world benchmarks:

```
POST /rpc/ethereum # Automatic routing based on passive performance measurement
```

Want much better reliability? Lasso will quietly retry your failed request with circuit breakers and intelligent failover—your application stays resilient when providers don't.

Want to build your own blockchain node infrastructure? Start with Lasso as your orchestration layer.

## Built on Elixir/OTP: Fault-Tolerance by Design

Lasso runs on the Erlang BEAM VM, a battle-tested platform that powers highly scalable platforms like WhatsApp, Discord, Supabase, and telecom infrastructure serving billions of users. This gives us superpowers:

- **Massive concurrency**: Handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal overhead
- **Fault isolation**: Provider failures don't cascade—each connection runs in its own lightweight process
- **Self-healing**: Crashed processes automatically restart without affecting others
- **Hot code updates**: Deploy fixes without downtime
- **Distributed by default**: Simple and high level primitives to coordinate across multiple nodes and regions

## Core Features

- **Multi-provider orchestration** with pluggable routing strategies (fastest, cheapest, priority, round-robin)
- **Full JSON-RPC compatibility** via HTTP and WebSocket proxies for all standard read-only methods
- **RPC Method failover** with per-provider circuit breakers and health monitoring
- **Passive benchmarking** using real traffic to measure provider performance per-chain and per-method
- **Performance tracking** - measures real RPC call latencies to optimize provider selection
- **Live dashboard** with real-time insights, provider leaderboards, and performance metrics
- **Globally distributable** with BEAM's built-in clustering and fault-tolerance

## Global Distribution Potential

BEAM's distributed capabilities unlock powerful possibilities for smart routing:

- **Regional nodes**: Deploy Lasso instances globally, each maintaining region-local performance benchmarks
- **Latency-aware routing**: Clients connect to the nearest Lasso node, which routes to the fastest upstream provider for that region
- **Cross-region coordination**: Nodes can share performance data to optimize routing decisions globally
- **Edge deployment**: Run Lasso close to your users for minimal added latency

This architecture scales from a single self-hosted instance to a global network of coordinated nodes.

## Usage

### HTTP vs WebSocket

- WebSocket (WS): Subscriptions (e.g., `eth_subscribe`, `eth_unsubscribe`) and read-only methods.
- HTTP (POST /rpc/:chain): Read-only methods proxied to upstream providers.
  - WS-only methods over HTTP return a JSON-RPC error with a hint to use WS.

### Provider Selection Strategy

The orchestrator uses a pluggable route-based strategy to pick providers when forwarding HTTP calls.

- Default: `:cheapest` (prefers free providers)
- Alternatives: `:fastest` (performance-based), `:priority` (static config), `:round_robin` (load balanced)

Try all 4 strategies with these endpoints:

```bash
# 💰 CHEAPEST - Prefers free providers to save costs
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/rpc/cheapest/ethereum \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'

# ⚡ FASTEST - Routes to best-performing provider based on real latency data
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/rpc/fastest/ethereum \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'

# 📊 PRIORITY - Uses static configuration priorities
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/rpc/priority/ethereum \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'

# 🔄 ROUND_ROBIN - Load balances across all available providers
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/rpc/round-robin/ethereum \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'
```

## Key Feature: Real Performance Tracking

Unlike traditional load balancers, Lasso uses **real RPC call measurements** for intelligent routing:

1. **Track actual RPC latencies** from your production traffic
2. **Build provider leaderboards** based on real performance data
3. **Route requests intelligently** using the `:fastest` strategy
4. **Automatic failover** when providers fail or slow down

This gives you production-grounded performance data without synthetic benchmarks or artificial load.

## Live Dashboard

Access the real-time dashboard at `http://localhost:4000`:

- **Provider leaderboards** with win rates and average latency
- **Performance matrix** showing RPC call latencies by provider and method
- **Circuit breaker status** and provider health monitoring
- **Chain selection** to switch between networks
- **System simulator** for load testing

## Architecture

Built on **Elixir/OTP** for fault-tolerance and massive concurrency:

- **Process isolation**: Each provider connection runs in its own lightweight process
- **Circuit breakers**: Automatic failover when providers fail
- **Self-healing**: Crashed processes restart automatically without affecting others
- **Hot updates**: Deploy fixes without downtime
- **Distributed ready**: Simple clustering across multiple nodes/regions
